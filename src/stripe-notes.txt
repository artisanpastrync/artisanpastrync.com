For this integration to work we need to:

1)    Create a Stripe Checkout session from our Next.js API route
2)    Redirect the user to Stripe with the session ID created
3)    Handle successful payments by redirecting the user back to our website’s success URL
4)    Handle failed payments by redirecting the user back to our website’s cancel URL
